        <p class="description">Maasai Mara is one of the most famous and important wildlife conservation and
            wilderness areas in Africa, world-renowned for its exceptional populations of lion, leopard, cheetah
            and African bush elephant. It also hosts the Great Migration, which secured it as one of the
            Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, and as one of the ten Wonders of the World.
            It is no surprise that tourists from the world over travel here to experience a Masai Mara Safari tour,
            more so as the reserve has been voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. Regarding the origin of the name,
            the word 'Masai' comes from the Maasai tribe, nomadic inhabitants of the area and the word 'Mara' is t
            heir word for 'spotted', referring to the ubiquitous flat topped acacia trees, shrubs and bushes
            that dot the landscape across most of the reserve.</p>

        <p class="desc">November is one of the Best times to visit Kenya, especially to visit its prime park,
            Maasai Mara. This is because the large migratory herds would have returned to Tanzania and now
            the Big cats have to venture long distances to hunt their prey.</p>
        <p class="desc">November is also the season of short rains. This makes the plains of Maasai Mara lush green.
            The skies are truly dramatic and colourful. The Sun rise and Sun sets during November at Mara is
            simply breath taking.</p>
        <p class="desc">November is also a time for holidaying and getting together with our families. And the icing on the
            cake is we have curated this itinerary for such an affordable costs without compromising on any of
            the services. This is commemorate our first year anniversary of opening up operations at Nairobi.

                to embark on your journey to Maasai Mara.The road journey takes about 5 to 6 hours, but you would
                be amazed by the landscape enroute. You would first see the Nairobi national park on your left side.
                On a lucky day, you would also see a White Rhino grazing near the fence. Nairobi city has a national
                park right in its heart!! And it is home for Lions, Leopards, White rhinos, gazelles, Giraffes, crowned
                cranes, and other mammals and birds. This is the only city in the World which boasts a National park within
                the city limits.<span id="moreContent">
                    After one hour you would climb up to The Great Rift Valley. This is one priced attraction of Kenya.
                    Formed a millions years back, this valley boasts beautiful lakes and escarpments, which provide
                    havens for plentiful wildlife.The Great Rift Valley runs for 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers), from
                    Jordan in southwestern Asia to the coast of the Indian Ocean in central Mozambique. We suggest
                    you request your driver to stop when you are on top and enjoy the views of this Nature’s marvel.

                    After lunch, you would go on your first game drive on the great plains of Maasai Mara!!"
                    This afternoon, our experienced Maasai guides/drivers would take you around the Talek and Topi
                    plains area. There you would find a lot of ungulates, antelopes, zebras and also a huge pride of
                    Lions. This pride is called the ‘Topi Pride’. Relax, sit back and enjoy God’s creations. You would
                    be so excited to see the endless plains of Maasai Mara with its dwellers.

            <p>Today is a very busy day for you at Mara. Wake up early, freshen yourself,
                have a hot beverage and jump into your designated vehicles. Today you would be going towards
                the border of Maasai Mara. You would be going for a full day game drive with packed breakfast
                and lunch.
                <span id="more-content">
                    Sand river is the border for Maasai Mara and Tanzania. This has been the entry point of the
                    migratory animals for millions of years. You would be amazed to see such a small river separates
                    two different countries!! Enjoy every bit your time as this is your last day of game drive for this trip.
                    Have lunch and take a small nap like our Maasai guides. Then proceed towards your camp. On the
                    way back encounter a pride of lion. During your stay at Mara, you would have seen the Big 4 our of
                    the Big 5. The Rhino being very elusive is going to be a difficult find. But this area is know for the
                    Rhinos. If you are lucky you would get to see one.
                    Return to the camp with great memories. Spend you evening at the camp fire before having dinner.
                    Retire for the day.
                    Sadly the holiday has come to an end. But at the end you would release that it was the journey
                    which was so beautiful. Have a blissful night. ( BLD )
